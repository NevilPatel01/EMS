# Employee Management System
This console program is designed to manage employee data stored in a CSV file. Here's how it works:

## Features:
### Employee Class:

- Represents information for a single employee.
- Includes properties for employee name, number, pay rate, hours worked, and gross pay.
- Ensures data accuracy and encapsulation.

### Main Class (Lab1):

- Provides functionality to read data from the CSV file into an array of Employee objects.
- Implements a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Utilizes a custom sorting algorithm to sort employee data based on various criteria.
- Ensures error checking for user input and exception handling during data reading.

### Menu Options:

Sort by Employee Name (ascending)
Sort by Employee Number (ascending)
Sort by Employee Pay Rate (descending)
Sort by Employee Hours (descending)
Sort by Employee Gross Pay (descending)
Exit

### Sorting Algorithm:

- Utilizes a custom sort method, not relying on existing class methods.
- Researched and implemented sorting algorithm ensures efficiency and accuracy.
- Provides a neat and orderly display of employee information after sorting.

### Gross Pay Calculation:

- Calculates gross pay for each employee based on pay rate and hours worked.
- Overtime is considered after 40 hours, with overtime pay at time and a half.

## How to Run:
- Compile and run the Lab1 class.
- Choose from the menu options to perform sorting or exit the program.
- View the sorted employee data displayed in a neat and orderly table format.
- Repeat the process as needed until exiting the program.

## Note:
- This program ensures data accuracy, encapsulation, and efficient sorting algorithms.
- Error checking and exception handling are implemented to handle invalid user input and file reading errors.
- The sorting algorithm used is custom-made to meet the program's requirements.
